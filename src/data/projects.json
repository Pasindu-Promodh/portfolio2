    "description": "A vibrant, candy-themed endless tower-hopping game where players rotate color wheels to match bouncing balls mid-flight.",
    "longDescription": "Color Bounce is a fast-paced, endless arcade game where precision and timing meet colorful strategy. Players control a bouncing ball that drops from tower to tower. Players must tap in time to align the correct color segment before the ball lands. If the color matches, the ball bounces to the next tower—if not, it's game over. With a candy-inspired visual style, upbeat sound effects, and increasingly challenging speeds, the game offers both a casual pick-up-and-play vibe and rewarding skill progression. I handled gameplay programming, visual effects, and touch input optimization for mobile devices.",
